# Obsidian move todo

A Community Plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) that adds a menu item to move a plugin to another daily note.

Once installed and enabled, this will show a new menu option called "Move todo: move to another day..."

Selecting this option will bring up a selection modal to select a daily note to move the currently selected todo items to.
